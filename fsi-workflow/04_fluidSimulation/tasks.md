# Step 4: simulation of Fluid domain

In this section we'll use the previously generated Fluid Mesh to perform a single physics simulation.
This will allow us to perform two important tasks:

- check the validity of our model
- obtain an initialized fluid domain, to be used in the FSI simulation

## Introduction

Short description: steady state

## Setup

- copy mesh
- setup some parameters: nu velocity
- setup turbulence
- setup tresholds for residuals

## Run the case

run simulation

## Monitoring?

pyFoamPlotWatcher

## Analysis of the results
