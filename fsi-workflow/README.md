# A workflow for fluid-structure interaction simulation with preCICE

In this community-contributed part of the [preCICE training course](https://precice.org/community-training.html), we are going step by step through the process of creating a fluid-structure interaction simulation coupling [CalculiX](http://calculix.de/) and [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/) via [preCICE](https://www.freecad.org/). We start by creating the meshes for both solvers, using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) and snappyHexMesh. We then setup and run single-physics simulations, before we couple them.
