# preCICE training course: Community contributed modules

Training material developed together with the preCICE community, complementing the [preCICE training course](https://precice.org/community-training.html). [Contact us](https://precice.org/community-channels.html) if you would like to create such a module together and maybe present it at the one of the next preCICE Workshops.

Modules:
